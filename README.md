# Description of application
In the work day schedule application, a user can view their workday (hours 9-5). 

The hours are color coded so that the user can easily view the current hour (Red), the future hours (Green), and the hours that have past (White). 

The user can then also type in tasks that they would like to do throughout the day, specific to each hour. When the user clicks the save button, whatever they typed in will save and stay until the user decides to erase it and save again.
